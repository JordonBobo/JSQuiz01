### Description
This is a concept for a generic quiz that uses JS to populate, evaluate, and grade a quiz. Any number of questions can be added with 4 possible answers into the array on the java.JS page. The quiz is timed and incorect answers reduce the amount of time remaining while also lowering the score directly. Correct answers add to the final score. Time remaining is also added to the final score. The page stores the top 3 attempts and displays them in the bottom scoreboard. Clicking submit without filling in the form refreshes the page without saving the score.
